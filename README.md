## Slack Laravel Client

Supported Laravel versions 5.5 - 8+

Based on [gpressutto5/laravel-slack](https://github.com/gpressutto5/laravel-slack)

Slack notification for Laravel as it should be.
Since it uses On-Demand Notifications, it requires Laravel 5.5 or higher.

## Installation 

Require this package in your composer.json and update your dependencies:

```bash
composer require michaelthuren/slack-laravel-client
```

Since this package supports Laravel's Package Auto-Discovery
you don't need to manually register the ServiceProvider.

After that, publish the configuration file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="MichaelThuren\SlackLaravelClient\ServiceProvider"
```

You're gonna need to configure an ["Incoming Webhook"](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks) integration for your Slack team.

## Configuration

On the published configuration file `config/laravel-slack.php`
you can change options like the Webhook URL, the default channel,
the application name and the application image.

For security reasons you shouldn't commit your Webhook URL,
so this package will, by default, use the environment variable
`SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`. You can just add it to your `.env` file.
Like this:

```dotenv
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

## Usage

You can send simple Slack messages like this:

- Send message to a channel:

```php
\Slack::to('#finance')->send('Hey, finance channel! A new order was created just now!');
```

- Send message to an user:

```php
\Slack::to('@joe')->send("Hey Joe! It looks like you've forgotten your password! Use this token to recover it: as34bhdfh");
```

- Send message to multiple users:

```php
\Slack::to(['@zoe', '@amy', '@mia'])->send('I swear, honey, you are the only one... :heart:');
//         ↑  look at this array  ↑
```

- Mix it up:

```php
\Slack::to('#universe', '@god', '#scientists')->send(':thinking_face:');
//         ↑ what? I don't need that array? ↑
```

- No recipient:

```php
\Slack::send('Default message to the default channel, set on config/laravel-slack.php.');
```

- Send SlackMessage objects:

```php
class HelloMessage extends SlackMessage
{
    public $content = "Hey bob, I'm a sending a custom SlackMessage";
    public $channel = '@bob';
}
\Slack::send(new SlackMessage());
```

- Send to user:

    You can use any object as a recipient as long as they have the
    property `slack_channel`. If you are using Models you can just
    create the column `slack_channel` and store the `@username` or
    the `#channel` name there. If you already store it but on a
    different column you can create a method `getSlackChannelAttribute`.

```php
class User extends Model
{
    public function getSlackChannelAttribute(): string
    {
        return $this->attributes['my_custom_slack_channel_column'];
    }
}
\Slack::to(User::where('verified', true))->send('Sending message to all verified users!');
```

## Testing

When testing you can easily mock the Slack service by calling
`Slack::fake()` it will return a `SlackFake` object that won't
send any message for real and will save them to an array.
You can get this array by calling `Slack::sentMessages()`.

This class also has some helper methods for you to use when
testing:

- Assert that at least one message with the content 'fake' was sent:

```php
Slack::assertSent(function (SlackMessage $message) {
    return $message->content === 'fake';
});
```

- Assert that at least two messages with the content
being a string longer than 5 characters were sent:

```php
Slack::assertSent(function (SlackMessage $message) {
    return strlen($message->content) >= 100;
}, 2);
```

- Assert that exactly five messages where the content
content contains the word 'test' were sent:

```php
Slack::assertSent(function (SlackMessage $message) {
    return strpos($message->content, 'test') !== false;
}, 5, true);
```

- Assert that exactly three messages were sent:

```php
Slack::assertSentCount(3);
```

- More test helper methods are coming...

Since this package uses `illuminate/notifications` to send notifications
you can mock the Notification service instead of the Slack one
and use the class `NotificationFake` in your tests.
